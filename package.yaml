# Metadata used when publishing your package
#synopsis:            This password generator was inspired by this comic of Randall Munroe: https://xkcd.com/936/.
#category:            Security

# To avoid duplicated efforts in documentation and dealing with the
# complications of embedding Haddock markup inside cabal files, it is
# common to point users to the README.md file.
